# FAAD2 WASM Bindings

This project provides a WebAssembly (WASM) binding for the FAAD2 AAC decoder, allowing it to be used in web applications.  
The main motivation to provide a WASM based `FAAD2Decoder` replacement is to support decoding of AAC audio streams in environments where the native `AudioDecoder` API is not available or does not support AAC.

Currently only Chromium-based seem to natively support AAC-HE decoding - but there is no support for PS (Parametric Stereo).
This library allows you to decode AAC-HE and AAC-HE-v2 with PS in browsers that do not support it natively.

## Usage

```javascript
import FAAD2Decoder from '@ohrstrom/faad2-wasm/faad2_decoder.js'
```

`FAAD2Decoder` works as a drop-in replacement for [AudioDecoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioDecoder)

```javascript
const audioDecoder = new FAAD2Decoder({
  output: processAudio,
  error: onEncoderError,
});

const asc = new Uint8Array([0x13, 0x14, 0x56, 0xe5, 0x98])  
await audioDecoder.configure({
  'mp4a.40.5',
  sampleRate: 48_000,
  numberOfChannels: 2,
  description: asc.buffer,
})

```
